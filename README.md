# Analog-Clock
In this project I style the needles of clock using CSS.
Use javascript to power it to show current time. Update every seconds so that it ticks like an actual clock. 
I also showed the digital readout of the time, date and month.
I also add a functionality to toggle it to dark and light mode.
